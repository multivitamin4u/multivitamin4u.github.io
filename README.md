Installation
------------

For the most part it is simply a question of dropping
the files into a folder and serving them up from there.

If any changes are made to the underlying javascript 
files, then the script-loader.php will need to be run, as follows:

    php script-loader.php > scripts/script-loader.js
    
This step is done to avoid needing an environment that provides php on the public facing server. For example, 
this allows the project to hosted on `github.io`.

Getting TLE data
----------------

While TLE data (Two-Line Elements) is included in the project, it won't be up to date.

If you wish to get current TLE data, then head over to [Space Track](https://www.space-track.org/), 
login and then you can use the following URL:
